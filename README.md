# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app

![Design preview for the Advice generator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to the Advice generator app from Front End Mentor. Using the Advice Slip JSON APi (https://api.adviceslip.com/), I fetched data from the API and had the HTML for the advice text generate from a button click. I used root variables from the style guide, and tried to get the project to look as close to the design as I could.
